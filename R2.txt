For the 5 trace files, only a subsequence of the intermediate routers are the same from routers 1 - 11 (inclusive).
From router 12 (inclusive) to the end of the trace route, they are either in different order, as they are ordered by
    TTL, or are different intermediate routers. The difference in the intermediate routers may be caused by various
    reasons, but a primary reason would be load balancing between the different routers, or if the next hop is already
    loaded into the cache, it will use such route.
All the intermediate routers are listed for each trace file above, and are ordered by TTL. The intermediate routers
    that are different than the other intermediate routers in the different trace files are marked by *.

The last hop before the ultimate destination has an abnormal rtt, router 8, thus router 8
    is most likely to incur the maximum delay due to an unstable or busy connection.
